Personal projects analyzing topics of interest.

## Project 1: Are we seeing the end of the labubu craze?
### Tools:
- Python (pytrends, matplotlib, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
### Results: 
The labubu trend is on a decline, after just a short 3 month period of popularity, which is comparative to the sonny angel craze. Perhaps indicating that such viral products have a maximum life expectency of 3 months. 
### Future Considerations:
- How has Popmart's stock value been impacted by the virality of the labubu?
- Does the popularity of blind box coincide with the rise of online gambling casinos?
